<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 914px; height: 416px; float: left; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-522" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Tearful-Surrender-concept-art-6.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler" width="600" height="464" /><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045aaa" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 914px; height: 416px;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">How do you express your creativity? How did you become interested in your creative practice? </span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I have various outlets for my creativity. I love being involved with film/camera work, photography, spfx makeup, lighting, wardrobe, painting, design, sculpture, writing, acting, drawing, poetry, just to name a few, with my main interest in writing, directing, and photography. </span></span>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I became interested in filmmaking and acting as a child when I first saw <u>King Kong</u>. Fay Wray screaming fascinated me at the age of 3, and I asked my mom, “Can I be her when I grow up?” My mom, said, “Yes, she’s an actress. You can be an actress. You can be whatever you want.” Of course, I found that I prefer being behind the camera, but from an early age I found I was obsessed  with the cinema and wanted to be creatively involved with it. I mean, come on, screaming in front of the camera as a job? Hell yeah. My dad also taught me how to draw and paint when I was very young, which I am grateful for as drawing is my favorite method of brainstorming for projects.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 914px; height: 706px; float: left; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045aba" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 914px; height: 706px;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-523" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Tearful-Surrender-poster.jpg" alt="Cassandra-Sechler-Tearful-Surrender-poste" width="450" height="679" /></span></span></span></span></span></span>

&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">How do you decide if an idea is viable? Do you act on all your creative ideas? </span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Even if I had all the money in the world I wouldn’t act on every idea I had. Some of my ideas are ridiculous! Often my ideas that are rooted in genuine interest and passion come from my dreams and nightmares. I know that they are worth doing 1) because I feel it in my heart, gut, and loin, and 2) because I can make them happen no matter the team or budget. Budget is always a concern but never something that holds me back. I make things happen because a voice and feeling inside my body tells me that a thought/story/feeling I have is worth trying to tell the world. </span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">What are you working on currently?</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Currently, I am working on two feature length projects: <u>Elliot</u> and <u>Tearful Surrender</u>. <u>Elliot</u> is a dystopian sci-fi/horror film, and for that I’m the Assistant Director, key Makeup Artist, actor, camera operator, and lighting designer on the project. <u>Tearful Surrender</u> is an erotic horror trilogy where I am acting as writer, director, cinematographer, costume designer, and much more. I am working on the art of wearing as many hats as possible on both projects! I am also in the middle of writing the script for my next feature film.</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">How have you made it financially possible to focus on your creative work?</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">The expression “don’t quit your day job” rings true here. I work two jobs to pay rent, bills and support my art. I am the lead director at Dreams For Dead Cats Productions, a DIY art/film collaborative here in San Francisco, co-run by filmmaker/musician Craig Jacobson. Together we work as freelance photographers/videographers/editors/actors/you name it, with the goal being to help bring zero/low budget projects with a soul to life and promote underground artists. I also have my day job as a graphic designer/Administrative Assistant/social media coordinator for a non profit called the Friends of Sharon Art Studio. </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-521" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Tearful-Surrender-concept-art-5.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler Tearful Surrender concept art " width="700" height="541" />
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 700px; height: 541px; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045aja" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 700px; height: 541px;"><span class="pv-zb-text pv-bgcolor1"><span class="pv-zb-text-c pv-font2 pv-color2">Tearful Surrender concept art, Copyright, Cassandra Sechler, 2016.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Most all of what I do creatively is self-funded because I want final say in my work with no outside producers. I’ve had a couple projects partially financed with crowd-funding and donations, which has been a great experience, and still allowing me to have final say in the project.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">What are some of your influences? </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">My biggest influences are my dreams/nightmares and feelings about life, social issues, and various existential crises I want to confront. I’m also influenced by my favorite artists, such as David Cronenberg, John Carpenter, Cindy Sherman, Charlie White, Francis Bacon, Kenneth Anger, and many others. My influences are constantly evolving, often stemming from my subconscious.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-510" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Elliot-Concept-Art.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler Elliot Concept Art" width="600" height="464" />
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 914px; height: 706px; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045aka" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 914px; height: 706px;"><span class="pv-zb-text pv-bgcolor1"><span class="pv-zb-text-c pv-font2 pv-color2">Elliot concept, Copyright, Cassandra Sechler, 2016.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">How do you record or remember and respond to your dreams? Do you keep a dream journal?</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I’ve kept dream journals since I was a teenager. Remembering my dreams and being inspired by them has been important to me for many </span></span><span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">years. When I was a child I would awake from hideous nightmares screaming and crying. My dad taught me to love my dreams AND my nightmares. He reminded me of how much I love horror movies and that nightmares were FREE horror movies. He tol</span></span><span>d me to always write down my most vivid dreams and to remember my nightmares and make them into art. So, yes, I keep a dream journal/sketchbook and write/draw about anything that stood out in a dream of mine. I have many recurring dreams, issues and fears I must confront in both my dreams and my art. It’s a beautiful and inspiring ordeal to deconstruct such dreams.</span>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">There are macabre, dark themes running through much of your work, can you describe how they enable you to express your vision?</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">When I see people smiling, laughing, riding bikes through the park or having a picnic with their families and being “happy” I feel that it’s such a lie. Just call me Holden Caulfield. For me, it is much more honest to portray unhappiness, dark thoughts, and macabre imagery. I want to talk about death, sickness, sadness, sexuality, etc. It’s healthy. People who smile all the time without a care in the world frighten me. Macabre is beautiful. Macabre is honest. </span></span>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Tearful-Surrender-concept-art-4.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler Tearful Surrender concept art 4" width="700" height="541" />
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 700px; height: 541px; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045ala" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 700px; height: 541px;"><span class="pv-zb-text pv-bgcolor1"><span class="pv-zb-text-c pv-font2 pv-color2">Tearful Surrender concept, Copyright, Cassandra Sechler, 2016.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">For the uninitiated, could you talk about the intersection between sexuality and horror? Tell us about the erotic horror anthology you have in the works.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Sex and death have always be</span></span><span>en of interest to me. They are so close to being the same thing, and are so beautiful, sad, and fascinating to me. Sexuality and horror tie together so well because both are intense, sometimes violent, dangerous, dark aspects of humanity and psychology. What makes them so entertaining is that they are so revealing of all of our fears and thoughts about mortality and the</span><span>self, both worth examining and fantasizing about.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler Portrait 3" width="636" height="960" />
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><u>Tearful Surrender</u> is an erotic horror trilogy that explores the fantastical facets of love, death, eroticism, and the unknown. Filled with lust, the hunger for blood, the mysteries of immortality, demons, zombies, necrophilia, and copious amounts of blood, each story uses nature, sexuality, and violence to represent the sadness of what it is to be immortal. With this film, I want to examine the terrors and desires of the unknown, the unforgiving qualities of love, the struggle to understand these desires, and the acceptance of fate of inevitable death alongside the pains of longing. Each story examines the heartache and frustration of what it is to be an immortal monster in this lonely world. </span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">What challenges have you faced in your creative work?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Besides funding challenges, which are always an issue for DIY/micro budget films and projects, I would have to say that the biggest struggle has been finding like-minded artists to work with who are as passionate about art but can leave their ego at the door (AKA trustworthy, honest, hard working individuals…sounds easy but it’s not). It’s been a challenge to stand your own ground with making projects that are tough to swallow while so many others are making pictures for the sake of distribution or recognition. It can be daunting to know what you’re doing may only appeal to a limited amount of people, but you also have to recognize you’re still communicating with people on a subconscious level no matter what size the audience, and hopefully connecting with people in a way that stimulates meaningful conversation.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Have you ever reached an impasse where you thought the project had become impossible? What changed your mind?</span></span>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Roadblocks. Issues. Nightmares. Anxiety. Of course! With low budgets, sometimes a little voice inside pokes you and asks you if you really want to continue and if something is “worth it.” It’s a bigger voice, filled with integrity, pride, and passion, that speaks up and yells, “I want to do this, and nothing will stop me!” When I have a vision, setbacks, funding issues or not, I keep going, because the light inside of me can’t be pushed out by fear or any other anxiety in the air.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-515" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Photography-1.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler Photography 1" width="720" height="551" />
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 720px; height: 551px; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045aoa" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 720px; height: 551px;"><span class="pv-zb-text pv-bgcolor1"><span class="pv-zb-text-c pv-font2 pv-color2">Photograph Copyright Cassandra Sechler, 2016.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Are you more motivated by intrinsic interest in a project or extrinsic accolades and rewards, or both? What do you do if you don’t get the response you want after completing a project? Do you care more about your audience “getting it” or about keeping true to your vision?</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I never get involved in or write a project in the interest of the genre or a specific audience, nor do I care about money when it comes to the future of a film. I make something because I want to, and because something inside me compels me to do so. I don’t make films for attention. I make films to tell a story that burns inside me with visuals. If the audience doesn’t “get it” they can go back to playing games on their phones, and forget about it. What’s important to me is that my team and I collaborate on an idea and bring a concept to the screen that we’re happy with. </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Do you think artists should starve? (I.e. inherently?)</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I think an artist should pay one’s dues but not starve inherently. I know I definitely literally often “starve” whether it be sacrificing meals or whatnot to make things happen when filming a project out of pocket. That’s life. I personally like sweating and bleeding to be able to make my art. It makes life worth living and a concept worth sharing. But…inherently?  Maybe not. Everyone should be able to see the fruits of their labor and starve a little less in life, especially if their work is good! </span></span>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">How can people view and stay up-to-date with your creative work? </span></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I always post news about screenings, art shows, and what I am working on via my <a href="http://cassandrasechler.com" target="_blank">personal site</a> as well as my <a href="http://dreamsfordeadcats.com" target="_blank">production site</a>  where people can sign up for our newsletter and find links to related social media accounts. </span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">What are some ideas you are still mulling over, or planning to tackle in the future?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">In addition to <u>Tearful Surrender</u>,  I have an erotic web series called <u>Windows</u> that I am writing and producing, as well as another two feature films with Dreams For Dead Cats Productions (a dark romantic comedy, and a dystopian science fiction fantasy film).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">
<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 914px; height: 914px; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_a4dc2639_15c045ara" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 914px; height: 914px;"></span></span></span></span></span></span><img class="alignnone wp-image-512" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cassandra-Sechler-Halloween-Hagatha-Cobweb.jpg" alt="Cassandra Sechler Halloween Hagatha Cobweb" width="600" height="600" />
<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">Finally, and maybe most importantly, what are your Halloween plans?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">I celebrate Halloween ALL year! However my specific Halloween plans are to carve a Jack-O-Lantern, dress up in costume (this year I shall be a mix of Sylvester Stallone’s and Brigitte Nielson’s characters in Cobra), eat junk food, make goodies to share with my neighbors (it is my Christmas after all), enjoy a few cocktails, tell ghost stories/read scary stories, and watch horror movies by the light of my Jack-o-Lantern until I pass out. It might sound simple, but there’s nothing I love more than curling up with my boyfriend and watching a movie, especially on Halloween…and ending the night with John Carpenter’s HALLOWEEN of course!</span></span>
