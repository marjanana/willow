<span style="font-size: 26px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Hello Phoenicians! I am searching for help putting together a community exhibit and event around incarceration and prison re-entry. I am looking for someone with good research and communication skills, someone who could contribute by doing some detective work by phone, and possibly in person. There is a time crunch and this event should take place before the beginning of November.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 26px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Working on this project would be a good way to learn more about resources in our Phoenix commun<span class="text_exposed_show">ity, get to know more about needs for those re-entering society from prison, and a way to learn more about the intersection of art, community and re-entry and the justice system at large. <a href="http://www.willowpaule.com/contact" target="_blank">Send me a message</a> if you want more information, or want to express your interest. Please share widely with your circle; I hope to find someone soon! <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/reentry?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10154024567899145"><span class="_58cl">?#‎</span><span class="_58cm">reentry?</span></a> <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/prisonreentry?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10154024567899145"><span class="_58cl">?#‎</span><span class="_58cm">prisonreentry?</span></a> <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/intersection?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10154024567899145"><span class="_58cl">?#‎</span><span class="_58cm">intersection?</span></a> <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/socialjustice?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10154024567899145"><span class="_58cl">?#‎</span><span class="_58cm">socialjustice?</span></a> <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/art?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10154024567899145"><span class="_58cl">?#‎</span><span class="_58cm">art?</span></a></span></span></span>
