<p>You know when you learn a new word or understand a new concept and suddenly it starts appearing everywhere? I&#39;ve known the word vulnerable for some time, but I&#39;ve been concerned with vulnerability as it relates to photography and personal interactions with my subjects explicitly for the last few months. This exploration has led me to see conversations about vulnerability everywhere I look.

I often consider the vulnerability of my subjects. I thought about it repeatedly while I was <a href="http://psychoculturalcinema.com/seeing-beyond-prison-bars/" target="_blank">photographing ex-prisoners in Indonesia</a>. I still think about it as I begin to share the work with the public. Although my subjects have assured and reassured me that they want me to share the project (and with it, share their history with the world) I obsess about what it could really mean to their lives.</p>

<p>It could mean nothing. Perhaps nothing untoward would come of it, perhaps nothing would even <em>change</em> as a result of it. The project also has potential to add to the dialog about prison reform. That would be great, right?</p>

<p>However, I just read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/joshua-oppenheimer-wont-go-back-to-indonesia.html?_r=0" target="_blank">an article</a> about Joshua Oppenheimer&#39;s newest documentary <em>Senyap</em>, about <span>an optician who confronts the men who killed his brother during the 1960s Indonesian genocide. </span>Oppenheimer<span> says, as a result of this film and his first,<em> The Act of Killing</em> (which has former killers re-enact the killings they carried out in the Indonesian genocide), he does not feel it would be safe to return to Indonesia. The men he documented still have a large amount of power. He says, &quot;</span>I could probably get into Indonesia without incident. I&rsquo;m just not sure I would get out alive again.&quot;</p>

<p>I want to support my Indonesian friends in being truthful, even vocal, about their experiences with the Indonesian justice system, the prison system and all that came with that--extortion, violence, corruption. However, I don&#39;t want any more injustice to fall on their heads as a result of the project. It&#39;s something to consider. And reconsider.</p>

<p>As I work toward creating a final edit for this project, I&#39;ve shown the photographs to other artists and curators. A couple mentioned that my project has a similar, if somewhat lighter similarity to Nan Goldin&#39;s photo series, &quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.&quot; I spent a lot of time looking at Goldin&#39;s series when I was in art school and so those comments brought back a warm feeling despite some of the sadness captured in her photographs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/23/nan-goldin-photographer-wanted-get-high-early-age" target="_blank">This article</a> (with a silly, clickbaity title) from The Guardian says, &quot;Initially, because of her subject matter alone, [Goldin] was compared to Diane Arbus, who had made her name with photographs of so-called freaks and outsiders in the 1960s. Goldin, though, says she knew nothing about art photography or documentary when she saw Arbus&#39; work for the first time.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;What I remember most is that all the queens I knew hated her. Violently. In her portraits of drag queens, she stripped them and showed them as men. To me, the queens were not men. My work was much more respectful to them. I&#39;ve never thought of a drag queen as a man. That&#39;s really the last thing I think about when I look at them. They weren&#39;t women either, by the way, they were another species.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>I think Goldin is talking about her subjects vulnerability here. The drag queens wanted to be photographed as they saw themselves, not as something &quot;other.&quot; They didn&#39;t want to feel used, and they probably wanted to be understood, like most people want to be. Goldin photographed them &quot;as they were.&quot;</p>

<p>This seeing things as they are also relates to allowing for vulnerability in our daily approach to life. <a href="http://http://www.quinncreative.com/coaching-retreats/" target="_blank">Quinn McDonald, a creativity coach</a>, writer, and artist writes an shares almost daily blogs and she recently <a href="http://www.quinncreative.com/vulnerability-and-power/" target="_blank">wrote about vulnerability and power</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;At a recent gathering of writers, I was telling this story of finding my mother&#39;s love letters. I got to the part about cleaning out her house, finding her love letters to my father. They showed me another woman, one I had never known, and could scarcely believe existed, much less was the same woman I called my mother. When I tell this story, I tell audiences I will choke up, and I do.&nbsp; I don&#39;t cry, but my voice waivers and I have to pause and swallow. And when I did that, I saw several women look away. One was shaking her head, frowning.&quot;</p>

<p>Then McDonald quotes Bren&eacute; Brown, who studies vulnerability and who said, &quot;&quot;If we want to reclaim the essential emotional part of our lives and reignite our passion and purpose, we have to learn how to own and engage with our <span class="il">vulnerability</span> and how to feel the emotions that come with it....<span class="il">Vulnerability</span> sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren&#39;t always comfortable, but they&#39;re never weakness.&quot; Cutting out vulnerability from our life can have the illusion of power but, ultimately, we are more powerful leaving room for vulnerability.</p>

<p>I recently saw an installation piece at <a href="http://modifiedarts.org/events-and-exhibitions/maybe-tomorrow-darling-exhibition-kara-roschi/" target="_blank">Modified Arts</a> in Phoenix. It&#39;s by artist and curator Kara Roschi and the piece seems to be made up of dozens of sticky notes which hold different variations of the phrase, &quot;Don&#39;t cry.&quot; Roschi says she often cries and she thinks of it as a handicap in the workplace. I think she is probably right, especially in places where men are in dominant positions. However, I think crying can also leave room for vulnerability and we need to take stock in why we are crying. It could be a useful reminder to keep us centered, even productive. I&#39;ve learned more about being a sensitive person from Susan Cain&#39;s book <u>The Power of Introverts</u> and sensitivity to our feelings can help us stay grounded and vulnerable--in a good way.</p>

<p>I think about my own vulnerability. I notice that I waiver between tearing up when people tell sad stories on the news and wanting to avert my eyes like the woman in McDonald&#39;s class. It can feel like a heavy burden to feel all those intense emotions. Learning to feel and then compartmentalize is something I&#39;ve been slowly learning to do my whole life.</p>

<p>I am concerned with approaching my subjects with a vulnerable heart. I have defined my photographic style and it is slow, kind. Sometimes I like to photograph people repeatedly. I am building a relationship and getting to the essence of their story. I think keeping open and vulnerable will help me capture more truthful and engaging photos. Perhaps, even more importantly, staying vulnerable will help my subjects feel as if we had an equal exchange of energy.</p>
