My mom was recently helping me look for some photographs that I have stored at my parents&#39; home in Oregon. The film photos were from my capstone project for my certificate in Southeast Asian Studies from Arizona State University, which I did in Lopburi, Thailand and Phoenix, Arizona. I taught two separate groups of kids some basic photography skills (one in my newly acquired Thai language, yay me!) and had them capture their lives through photography.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: century gothic,applegothic,apple gothic,sans-serif;">I purchased disposable film cameras and gave the kids structured assignments to capture different things in their environment. They spent some time culling and editing their photos, and we discussed their work. We also talked about what it would be like in the other community halfway across the world. The kids from each group wrote each other letters about their lives and asking cultural questions.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: century gothic,applegothic,apple gothic,sans-serif;">I remember the Thai kids being surprised that the the majority of the kids I worked with in Phoenix were of color. They had encountered only white people in the American movies they watched or coming to their small town in Thailand, so it formed their perception of who Americans were. The American kids were impressed with the intricate lettering Thai kids employed when they wrote their letters and the fancy way they folded their letters.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: century gothic,applegothic,apple gothic,sans-serif;">I was impressed by the access the kids got. They had bewitchingly-natural photographs of their family doing everyday things like eating dinner or washing laundry. Perhaps this experience was formative for me; I have been gravitating more and more to documentary-style photography practice since then.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: century gothic,applegothic,apple gothic,sans-serif;">I photographed all the students from each group, and in 2004 I exhibited my photographs and theirs at Arizona State University.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: century gothic,applegothic,apple gothic,sans-serif;">I want to share the materials from this project with you as I start to scan some of the photographs. In the meantime, here is a photograph I made in the back of a car in Lopburi in 2004. This shows a rickshaw driver waiting for a customer. In 2015, there are still rickshaw drivers in Lopburi, but they are few and far between.</span></span></p>
