<p>WARNING: This is not a photo post, but it <em>does</em> contain important information.</p>

<p>I found out that this week, April 24-30, has been designated National Reentry Week by The Department of Justice. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/23/weekly-address-building-fairer-and-more-effective-criminal-justice">The release from The White House</a> states The Department of Justice will &quot;highlight how strong reentry programs can make our communities safer.&quot; President Obama says he plans to make it possible for previously incarcerated people to compete for federal jobs. Obama stressed &quot;this is about more than what makes economic and practical sense &ndash; it&rsquo;s about ensuring we live up to our nation&#39;s ideals.&quot;</p>

<p>I think John Oliver sums up the hurdles returning citizens face in this 19 minute piece on reentry. He interviews returning citizen Bilal Chatman at the end of this powerful segment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s encouraging to hear Bilal&#39;s story, that despite having been incarcerated, now he has found work and other pursuits (like growing tomatoes), that fulfill him. I like the attention President Obama is giving the justice system and mass incarceration. I like how more and more people are becoming invested in making changes. I want to be involved in helping to make change in the way the justice system and incarceration work in the US.</p>
