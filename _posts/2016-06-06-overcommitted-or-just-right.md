<span style="font-family: georgia,palatino,palatino linotype,times,times new roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">I started this blog entry and then Firefox crashed, as it often does. How frustrating. I felt unmotivated to begin writing again. I decided to take a nap and come back to it. Good call.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia,palatino,palatino linotype,times,times new roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">Suffice it to say, I have a lot going on in my life right now. I am trying to finish about 10 projects, many of which require research and much energy. I'm trying to be selective and limit commitments that don't directly benefit me or absolutely need to be made. Although I don't have a personal shopper or chauffeur, I DO take the bus to work most days, which allows me time to read and think on my way into the office, which helps me get centered for the day.</span></span>

In college, I was interested in my studies and motivated, but not as driven as I am now. I remember feeling annoyed when my mother asked what my plans for the day were. Now, most days, I feel like I just don't have enough time to do everything I want to do, and I very rarely feel bored. Something has changed. Also, I think my mortality has set in, and I know I have limited time of this earth, so I want to make the best of it.

<span style="font-family: georgia,palatino,palatino linotype,times,times new roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">In 2016, I am working on health and clean eating as well as self-improvement in other areas of my life. I'm taking classes and attending workshops, not to mention doing self-study. I am working on two major photo projects concurrently and working my full time job on the side (ha).</span></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia,palatino,palatino linotype,times,times new roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">I want to hear from my readers; how do you make plans that you can enact? How do you figure out the next steps when a project feels monumental? When do you decide to scale something back, break it into smaller chunks, or quit? How do you make sure you're getting things done the way you want to?</span></span>

NOT my to-do list, but a visual stand-in.
