<span style="font-family: georgia,palatino,palatino linotype,times,times new roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">I went to visit two of my favorite families last weekend. Remember <a href="http://www.willowpaule.com/blog/2016/2/maternity-and-motherhood-in-phoenix" target="_blank">Marilyn</a>? Last time I posted about her, she had a large pregnant belly. Now her boy has been born, and he is squirmy and very alive and Marilyn and her husband Tony are very much in love with him. As I arrived and sat down on the couch, Marilyn immediately put him in my arms. He told me he enjoys milk, sleep, mom, dad, and brother.</span></span>

His older brother wanted to show me and his friend his new car. He is a dare-devil and enjoys bashing into stationary targets like dumpsters, other cars, or not so-stationary targets like Auntie Willow. Needless to say, his friend was not impressed with his motor vehicle skills. His mother had to ride his car back home.

The next day, I dropped by Jessica's place where everyone was staying cool inside. Jessica was making potato salad and her family was watching a movie.Â  I told Cristian, Jessica's husband, about a problem with my car blinkers and he offered to fix them. I get treated well over there.
