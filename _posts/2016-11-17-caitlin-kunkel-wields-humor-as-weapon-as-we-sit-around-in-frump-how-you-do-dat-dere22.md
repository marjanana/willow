<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I talked with Caitlin Kunkel, comedy writer and satirist about her creative process a few months back. Enjoy this interview with her! (Click on any of the clips of her work interspersed throughout to link to her articles.)</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Caitlin, did you grow up around people who valued creativity? Humor?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Both my parents have very defined senses of humor--my mother is a nurse, and nurses are well known for black humor (which I love), and my father was sillier in what he would laugh at. I definitely always felt encouraged to make comedic commentary growing up. My sister Emily is a professional actor and my other sister Grace has the best sense of style of anyone I know, so we were certainly encouraged to exercise and develop our artistic sides.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">How did you become interested in writing?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I was pushed to write starting in elementary school, and it began to feel like the one place I could be heard. For some reason, I was an angry kid so my writing felt like a space to address my 8-year old concerns, like why in the world I hadn’t yet been permitted to have a puppy GOSH. Writing always felt like it came naturally to me and as more and more teachers noticed and praised me for it, it started to seem like something I really could focus on. It felt like the thing that differentiated me and made me unique.</span></span>

<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 423px; height: 448px; float: left; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_30b4f850_6e734aba" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><a href="http://reductress.com/post/how-to-throw-a-gender-reveal-party-that-reveals-everything/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-502" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-1.23.54-PM.png" alt="" width="423" height="448" /></a></span></span></span>
<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">How is it financially possible for you to focus on writing?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I supplement comedic writing with teaching and occasional copywriting jobs. I’ve taught screenwriting, English composition, and satire at Northwestern University and Pacific Northwest College of Art, and I pick up producing and consulting jobs as well. I teach satire and screenwriting online for Second City and that has been a wonderful job for me--the workload changes every month, and I can do it whenever it works best in my schedule. So now I tend to write in the morning and spend the afternoons doing paid work. There’s almost always overflow onto the weekends, but if I need to read a student’s funny list or write a sketch on a Saturday, that’s not so bad. I like to have a certain amount of steady, paid work lined up each month and then hustle for additional stuff on top of that. But if I have no idea where my income is coming from, I start to feel too anxious to work. So teaching has become my income anchor.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I will say that as a freelancer, my income is variable and it certainly makes a huge difference that my husband has a stable job that provides our health insurance. I also feel strongly that creative writers who primarily do creative writing should have skills in complementary fields like copywriting, in order to grab gigs along the way when it’s a tight month. I’ve also worked in fundraising and nonprofits over the years as I moved to being able to make my entire living from freelancing and teaching--it took me three years after graduate school and six years after finishing college to grow to that point.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I know you're a teacher for The Second City and recently I saw you share detailed updates about the creative work your students were doing. I appreciated what looked like a deep interest in your students. Besides a salary, what does teaching offer you?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I have found teaching to be unbelievably useful when it comes to clarifying concepts in my own head--in order to teach satire to people, I have to understand it on a much deeper level than I did when I was just writing for myself. It forces me to do more reading and to reinforce concepts in my head again and again--because I’m evaluating student work for comedic premises, strong points of view, and form, I have to develop a really sharp eye for those things in my work and the work of others.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I also get very inspired by the work of students, especially when they’re just starting out and they write some nutso stuff. You can see how unique and creative someone’s viewpoint is because they aren’t trying to ape another form, or emulate a website--this is coming 100% out of their own head. I love working with people new to comedy or new to creative writing. I know a lot of people think writing can’t be taught, but I couldn’t agree less--I think everyone has life experiences or viewpoints that they can be taught to express in a comedic way. You’re not telling them what to think, you’re just giving them some tools for ways to excavate their thoughts.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">How does creativity manifest for you? Is there any routine you must follow to find it? </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I keep a lot of lists, and I’m constantly reading news or asking myself how I feel about certain things. Since I write so much satire now, it’s become second nature to look at a news story and ask myself if I see a comedic angle that could be used to target someone or something in that story, or to make a larger point about something I want to criticize.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">In terms of a routine, I almost always start with a loose brainstorm freehand in a notebook and then start to translate ideas into word documents. I have to warm up to writing, and I do a lot of prep work (free writing, making lists of comedic beats, character bios) before I launch into a longer work like an article or a play.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I’ve noticed that if I’m not inputting a lot, by seeing new things in a lot of different mediums, reading comedic work, talking to people, my output will slow way down. So being stimulated through movies, TV, conversation, theater--that’s key for me to work.</span></span>

(Caitlin says these sketches are representative of successful satire.)

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">What are you working on currently? </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Currently I’m writing more sketches after taking a few years off from them, and focusing on humor and satirical written pieces. I’m also taking improv classes at Upright Citizen’s Brigade and doing some live storytelling after getting over my mistaken belief that I could never be a performer myself. It feels great to be trying things outside of my comfort zone and finally losing that immense sense of embarrassment that stalked me in my twenties.</span></span>

<img class="size-full wp-image-498 aligncenter" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ira-Quote-CK.jpg" alt="Ira Quote CK" width="604" height="453" />
<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">How do you decide if something you're writing is good?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I love this Ira Glass quote, because I think developing your taste level is as important as developing your writing chops. It’s always hardest to teach people who aren’t sure what they are trying to do, or who can’t tell when they’ve hit the mark or not. </span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I’m VERY critical of my own work, and now the metric I use for evaluating it is: 1) Is it clear what I am trying to do? 2) Have I been specific and pointed throughout? 3) Have I been honest with myself about the amount of work I’ve put into this, or am I just desperate to be done? That last one is really where I feel I’ve come a long way--now, I don’t try to lie to myself when something is done or good, I can objectively evaluate it and know. Once I feel the draft is strong, but not completely done, I almost always send it to a friend or one of my sisters to do a final read and get feedback on it. Then I polish it up from there.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I know you were based in Portland for a few years. Any marked differences between Portland and Brooklyn? </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Yes! There was a huge lack of diversity in Portland in so many ways--racially, culturally, and in terms of conflicting viewpoints. I found it very stifling creatively to work in a place where people all agreed on the same things, and where there wasn’t a lot of patience for viewpoints that made people feel uncomfortable or made them question their beliefs. For a satirist, that is death! Coming from Chicago, where so much satire focused on the problems the city was facing, it was very strange to me that audiences couldn’t find any humor in laughing at themselves and admitting that the city had some real and very big problems. There are just so many more voices chiming in in Brooklyn and New York--I enjoy the feeling of talking to someone and knowing they don’t agree with me.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">What are you reading?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Right now I’m in my summer hyperdrive mode, where I churn through 3-4 books a week. I read a lot of lighter stuff. I unabashedly love women’s fiction, and it would be my dream to write a novel in that genre someday (have some ideas I’m playing with!). In that vein I just read <u>Sweetbitter</u>, <u>Modern Lovers</u>, <u>So Close</u>, <u>The Assistants</u>, <u>The Ramblers</u>, and <u>Opening Belle</u>.<i> </i>I’m working on Samantha Bee’s autobiography as well, which is very much outside the normal style of celebrity memoirs.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">On the flip side of the coin, dystopian fiction and end of the world stuff is my jam – I taught a class on it at PNCA and it was a true highlight of my teaching career. I just reread <u>Station Eleven</u> by Emily St. John Mandel and it’s one the most beautifully haunting books I’ve ever read. The images have stuck with me for years, and this is probably the fourth time I’ve read the book. Highly recommended. And <u>The Stand</u>, of course. I reread that for the seventh or eighth time last year.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I’m about to dive into Stephen King’s <u>11/22/63</u> and then watch the Hulu series. I seriously cannot wait. Stephen King is always and forever my favorite author. I was daunted by the size of this book then read the first two pages and was already hooked. He’s incredible.</span></span>

<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 708px; height: 521px; clear: both; padding: 0px; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;"><span id="zfdp_30b4f850_6e734aga" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><img class="size-full wp-image-503 aligncenter" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-1.24.30-PM.png" alt="" width="708" height="521" /></span></span></span>
<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Are there any ideas you wish you had time to act on but haven't yet? Do you think it will become possible to act on them in the future? </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Like I said, I would love to write a novel. I do think I have the time (I’m a firm believer in 30 minutes a day getting you VERY far), but it’s more that I’m daunted by the idea of writing something so long. Even though I’ve written TV pilots, screenplays, and full-length plays, a book feels like a major, unwieldy thing that I don’t know how to wrangle. I know the only way to learn is to throw myself into it! I might take a class in the fall to get me going--I thrive with deadlines and like to use my sense of responsibility against myself (if I know I’m supposed to workshop in class, there’s no way I wouldn’t write the pages). </span></span>

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-501 aligncenter" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-1.23.23-PM.png" alt="emotions" width="624" height="522" />
<span>Do you consider yourself an artist? Should artists starve?</span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Yes, I consider myself an artist. No, artists shouldn’t starve, but I do think it’s unrealistic to think that you will be able to make a livable salary freelancing without any experience behind you. The work I did in offices, fundraising, teaching, copywriting--all that taught me a lot about deadlines, dealing with clients, handling work flow, etc. And at the end of the day, SO many things that come your way as an artist are from the people you know. So working a full-time job for several years and building your contact list can be incredibly valuable in the future as your cohort all starts to rise at the same time. I do think after gaining some contact and experience, people can start to dip their toe into freelancing and making more money from their art and see if they can come up with a sustainable source of income from it.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Having been a part-time professor at a college, I don’t think being a professor is a full-time job anymore for anyone but a lucky few. I think I will probably hold more full-time jobs in the future, but when I return to freelancing I will always be patching together income from a variety of different sources. Almost no one I know who is an artist makes their living exclusively from their art, and that’s fine--the metric for being an artist in my mind isn’t if you make $100k a year doing it, but if you’re DOING IT.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">Tell us something we don't know about you yet:</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;"><span style="font-family: Palatino,'Palatino Linotype','Hoefler Text',Times,'Times New Roman';">I was a state champion swimmer in high school and swam in college, and I think swimming is what gave me the attention span to be a writer. It’s just you looking down at the black line on the bottom of the lane, thinking your thoughts, feeling your body. I don’t feel my body as much in my office chair, but I’m very comfortable thinking my thoughts for hours on end and putting sustained focus into a piece.</span></span>

<span class="zb-richtext" style="width: 420px; height: 472px; float: left; padding: 0px; margin: 15px;"><span id="zfdp_30b4f850_6e734aia" class="pv pv-static pv-ready"><span class="pv-outer"><span class="pv-inner" style="width: 420px; height: 472px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-497" src="http://willowpaule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/comedian-kunkel.jpg" alt="portrait of kunkel" width="420" height="472" /></span></span></span></span>
