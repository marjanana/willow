<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">What I've been thinking about this week:</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><strong>Expectations</strong></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">1) People don't always do what they say they will, especially WHEN they say they will. This will never not be maddening. But I can work on my reaction to this phenomenon, and not let it make me to upset. When it starts annoying me, I try to think about the things <em>I</em> need to work on.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><strong>Priorities</strong></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">2) I love sleep but I also love staying up late at night. Unfortunately, I prefer mornings spent in bed, but that is not possible with a full time job and photography and film work. Last night, I chose finishing my homework but also two Tarantino films and then set my alarm wrong. I'm not perfect.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><strong>Leaning In</strong></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">3) Sticking with something when it's not necessarily "polite" or "normal" is hard for me. I think that's what scares me about journalism. I don't enjoy ruffling feathers or drawing attention to myself. But sometimes it worth it, when you want something really bad.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;"><strong>Organization</strong></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: palatino,palatino linotype,hoefler text,times,times new roman;">4) I've learned from experience to be very organized with my photographic libraries. But sometimes, I wish I were more damn organized! Yesterday, I spent hours trying to find a certain session, and was not successful. </span></span>
