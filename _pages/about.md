<h1>It's Me:</h1>
Ever since I was small, I have loved looking at old family photos for hours. I love the bowl cuts, the grainy, vintage look of the film, and the outdated yet endlessly entertaining fashion. My love affair for photography has to do with my fascination for it's capacity to express a subjectâ€™s personality in a two-dimensional space, and the way it allows us to see small details in faces and bodies. I've been formally trained in fine arts photography and informally schooled by myriad experiences with photographic subjects from around the world. I have a strong interest in humanity and find that my gift is helping people express their stories and way of life with my photographs. My images are used by non-profits, newspapers, and private clients.

I am often found in Southeast Asia and the US and I'm available to shoot anywhere. I photograph personal and business events, engagement photos, fashion, portraits, and more. Take a look at my Portfolio and Clients pages for examples. I speak Indonesian and Thai. I mostly shoot digital but hold a fondness for film and like to carry my red Holga around.

Clients often praise my calm and humorous demeanor which makes them feel relaxed. I've noticed that a calm person is a better-understood person. Part of making you comfortable is the research and communication I've done before the shoot, gathering information about exactly what you need from me. Your pleasure is of utmost concern to me!

So, you've gotten this far. Shoot me a <a href=" http://tattoomilan.net/contact/" target="_blank">message</a> to discuss our collaboration.
