On 14 February 2014 as a heavy mist of ash showered down on Central Java from Mount Kelud, a group of fifty women and men gathered to show their solidarity for the rejection of violence against women. The gathering for One Billion Rising was planned to take place on Jalan Malioboro in Yogyakarta, but because of the blanket of ash the event was moved undercover to the Taman Budaya (Cultural Center).

One Billion Rising is an annual event that takes place in 207 countries worldwide to raise awareness about violence against women. Every day, twenty Indonesian women become victims of sexual crimes and fifty percent of these cases constitute rape. <a href="http://www.insideindonesia.org/dancing-against-violence" target="_blank">Read more.</a>
