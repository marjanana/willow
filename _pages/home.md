<em>Willow Paule is a genius. She turned my vision into gallery-worthy art. There is something truly special about her work, something you'll never get with other photographers. She is an amazing person and a delight to work with. Hire Willow Paule; your ideas will morph into a masterpiece.</em>
- Lisa Baughn

My ongoing documentary photo projects address contemporary world issues in personal, street-level terms. Your support will help underwrite the work.
